# intan_neurosuite
A modified version of the Intan data acquisition software that is compatible with Neurosuite

This version of the Intan software saves the amplifier data, the
analog input data, and the accelerometer data in a single .dat file
in int16 format for use with Neuroscope and the rest of the Neurosuite
software.
